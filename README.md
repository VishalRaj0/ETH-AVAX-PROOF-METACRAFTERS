# ETH-AVAX-PROOF-METACRAFTERS
<h2>This repository is made for showing what I did in my ETH+AVAX Proof metacrafter assessment.</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Created a simple contract called MyContract.</li>
  <li>It has 3 functions inside it: forRequire(), forRevert(), forAssert().</li>
  <li>These 3 functions basically implement the require, revert and assert error handling methods.</li>
</ol>
